From Llama Guard paper

Figure 2 reports category-specific results when evaluating Llama Guard on the OpenAI moderation test
set. Note that the performance is lower than the overall binary classification performance since we penalize
the model for predicting the wrong category even though the model has correctly predicted the sample as
unsafe. This makes the setting much harder for Llama Guard since its taxonomy does not align well with
that of the OpenAI moderation set. For example, Llama Guard does not distinguish between the categories
Hate, Hate (Calling for Violence), and Violence. Further, Llama Guard taxonomy does not have specific
guidance for Sexual Content (Minors), Harassment, or Violence (Graphic). Note that, even in this case of
policy misalignment, few-shot prompting helps reduce gaps compared to zero-shot prompting, in accordance
with our previous findings.
